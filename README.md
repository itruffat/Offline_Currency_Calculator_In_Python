# Offline Currency Calculator In Python

This program is a simple calculator to quickly get the equivalency between two currencies with a few bells and whistles. It can be easily updated online (via the "currencyconverterapi.com" API) but it's mainly intended to work offline. 

There is nothing too great going on here. A calculator that has a simple interface that works with Python's terminal. The first version took me less than half an hour to make. Then I started adding a few things here and there, like the capability to update values online or add new currencies.
